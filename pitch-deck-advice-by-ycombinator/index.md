# Pitch deck advice by YCombinator

Ensure your pitch deck lines up with "The Pocket Guide of Essential YC Advice".

* Launch now
* Build something people want
* Do things that don’t scale
* Find the 90 / 10 solution
* Find 10-100 customers who love your product
* All startups are badly broken at some point
* Write code – talk to users
* “It’s not your money”
* Growth is the result of a great product not the precursor
* Don’t scale your team/product until you have built something people want
* Valuation is not equal to success or even probability of success
* Avoid long negotiated deals with big customers if you can
* Avoid big company corporate development queries – they will only waste time
* Avoid conferences unless they are the best way to get customers
* Pre-product market fit – do things that don’t scale: remain small/nimble
* Startups can only solve one problem well at any given time
* Founder relationships matter more than you think
* Sometimes you need to fire your customers (they might be killing you)
* Ignore your competitors, you will more likely die of suicide than murder
* Most companies don’t die because they run out of money
* Be nice! Or at least don’t be a jerk
* Get sleep and exercise – take care of yourself
